Sunday Services
 8:30 am Breakfast Service (atmosphere: casual)
This worship service begins with people gathering and eating breakfast together at 8:30 am every Sunday. After the breakfast, we gather for All Age Worship Service. All age groups participate in this small but intimate worship service. It is inclusive and fun. We learn to make mistakes as well as do things well in many different ways. If you enjoy interacting with different age groups, this service will help you belong to a church in a very new way.

<a name="traditional"></a><strong>10:30 am Traditional Service</strong> (atmosphere: formal)
During August, as part of our Learning the History series, we follow a  <a href="http://www.calvin500blog. files.wordpress.com/2009/03/thethe-form-of-church-prayers-and-hymns.pdf>worship liturgy used by John Calvin in Geneva in 1542</a>. In July we learned about and used the worship liturgy that was adopted by 1938 General Assembly of The Presbyterian Church in Canada. If you enjoy being part of traditional service or enjoy learning about history, this service is for you. Everyone is welcome.

<a name="Wed"></a><strong>Wednesday Evening Service</strong> (atmosphere: casual)
This service begins at 6:15 pm with a light BBQ supper (hamburghers, hot-dogs, etc.) as we come to make a new community. It is for those who do not know anything about what a church is. It is also a new way of inviting people to come to glorify and enjoy God. It is totally non-traditional. It is opened to a new way of expressing one's faith and hone skills spiritually for this changing world. If you are adventuresome, or have not been a part of church, or looking for something that is totally different than being in a regular church, this service might be for you. Come and try it. Everyone is welcome!

<a name="Friday"></a><strong>Friday Afternoon Service</strong> (atmosphere: casual)

For those who cannot regularly attend Sunday worship service, this one is for you. Since July, we have been meditating on Beatitudes. Our worship order is similar to the regular 10:30 am service. It is also for those who need a ride or assistance.

All these worship services are open to anyone who is interested in worshipping the Triune God.
